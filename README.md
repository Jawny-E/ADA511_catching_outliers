# Catching cheaters using an OPM
X
The problem of cheating has long plauged higher-education. Under immense pressure to meet high expectations some will,
sacrifice their integrity for the hope of a higher grade. Institutions have to fight an uphill-battle to try to keep 
pace with the arms-race of ever-evoloving cheating methods. The emphasis cannot only be on prevention, but also on
swift decisive action against those who chose dishonesty.

Scenario: You are a university lecturer and you have been informed that one student in your class was seen using their 
phone during the anonymous end-of-year exam. The university is pressuring you to identify the wronging party. You 
have all the exam answers, but is that enough? Can you employ techiques from ADA511 to assign probabilities of 
being the cheater to the different students?

This project is inspired by a Code-Jam Qualification round in 2021

## Project description

### Datasets
The project includes a Python script that can create datasets for you. The number of students and questions
are set as global variables, as well as the probabiltiy for the cheater successfully checking their phone. 

### Finding the question difficulty and student skill 
Before you can set out to find the cheater you need to use the dataset to estimate 
the difficulty levels of the different questions, and then figure out an estimate for the
different students skill-level. 

### Finding the probability of a student answering the way they did
Now that you have their skill levels and the question difficulty estimated

### Figuring out who the cheater is
Who answered the most unlikely for their skill-level after all of this?
